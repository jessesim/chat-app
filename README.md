 This is a real-time chat application that uses an HTML frontend that connects to WebSocket in the backend to display send and receive messages from one client to another instantly. WebSocket is being hosted by Elastic Beanstalk through AWS. As of now the app only allows two usernames one being yourself the other just named "friend" regardless of how many clients are on at once, this is something I would like to improve on in the future, assigning custom usernames per client. 

App can be viewed using this link: websocket-server-env.eba-crjzue9b.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
